# Business Insight & Recommendation
â€¢ The highest active customer in November 2017 was stagnant until August 2018, but in September - October it dropped very drastically,   there needs to be further analysis. As for product quality, the company's revenue looks good and continues to increase. However, the number of products canceled by customers is quite high, it is necessary to implement new innovations to improve this. You can analyze the cause of the cancellation of the product. Is it because of poor product quality, because the price is too high, or the product is not suitable.<br>
<br>
â€¢ Need to make improvements to product quality, either by meeting customer needs for products that are frequently sought after or by conducting marketing campaigns to promote products more frequently. So that revenue on all products can increase and can reduce the number of products that are canceled.<br>
<br>
â€¢ For payment methods, customers are increasingly literate with the use of non-cash payments, this can be seen from the growth in payment methods which increase every year. In this case we can provide offers/discounts for non-cash users to be able to trigger customer satisfaction and increase customer loyalty to the product.
